This RTC requires Socket.io, Node.js, and a VPS like render or railway.
Your chatroom folder should have another folder called "public" with index.html, style.css, and script.js.
outside of your "public" folder there should be server.js, and package.json.


To run server.js you type: "node server.js" into cmd.
cmd should say something like: "Server running at https://YourDomain/"
